Breakout Or Brick Breaker


Our game is a version of the popular brick breaking game in which players use a paddle and a ball to try and destroy a seires of bricks.

In our version of the game a player starts our with 3 lives and recieves points for each brick they break

If the ball falls bellow the paddle the player loses a life

If the player is advanced enough they can catch and hook the ball back up before it falls through, good luck with this one

The game will keep going until the player loses all their lives, if you destroy every brick they will respawn with an additional life for every level you clear.
